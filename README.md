# movie-seat-booking

The movie-seat-booking app was generated with vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

When you open the app with Live Server from your VScode-program, you can choose four awesome movies in the upper right drop-down box.

Select the amount of seats, and you can see the price changing for every seat that has been booked. 

When you push the refresh button of your web-browser, the selected movie and seats remain the same. For this I have used logic for local storage.

Feel free to inspect the source code. This project is never finished, and will receive regular updates in the future.

Happy Coding :)
